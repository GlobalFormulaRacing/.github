# Global Formula Racing  
  
Welcome to our GitHub Organization. We are **Global Formula Racing (GFR)**, the first international Formula Student collaboration between the **Oregon State University (OSU)** and **DHBW Ravensburg**!  

## About Us  
  
We share physical and intellectual resources using advanced technology to create two highly competitive vehicles. Design, manufacturing, and testing co-occur at DHBW and OSU, over nine time zones and 8770 kilometers apart. Our supply chain management is unique in Formula Student, and the bilingual team structure adds an extra dimension to the team.  
  
Since 2019 we are competing in the Electric and Driverless Categories.  
  
You can find more information about us on our [website](https://www.global-formula-racing.com/en/) or follow us on our social media accounts to stay up to date with what is happening in our team.

## Our Vehicles  
  
In the first season, 2010, we laid a foundation for the design of the following years by building two identical race cars at both universities. This baseline has been used since 2011 to develop and build two cars. The team at Oregon State University used to focus on the combustion car, and the team at DHBW concentrated on the electric vehicle. However, since 2020/2021, we have built a similar modular autonomous vehicle at both universities.

## International Experience  
  
The exchange program within our team enables students to benefit from international experience and further support a strong communication network.  
  
### Oregon State University  
  
Oregon State is a leading research university situated 90 miles south of Portland, and an hour from the Cascades or the Pacific Coast. Corvallis is one of the safest, smartest and greenest small cities in the nation.  
  
Oregon State University provides many outlets for Global Formula Racing to thrive. The College of Engineering generously enables students to utilize multiple rooms, machine shop, computer lab and a workshop that is shared with the SAE Baja team “Beaver Racing”. Possibly the highlight of all the accessible resources is our composites lab where we are able to manufacture carbon-fiber monocoques for both DHBW and OSU.  
  
### DHBW Ravensburg  
  
The Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW) is a corporative university, which combines theoretical education at the university with practical experience in a partner company. The DHBW Ravensburg is one of eight locations in Baden-Württemberg.  
  
The university supports us by sharing many resources and facilities with the team. A dedicated room serves as the office and workshop of the racing team. This room is the center of the team acitivities and assembling area of the electric racecar. In addition to that, the team is allowed to use a High-Voltage laboratory, seminar rooms, computer rooms and other laboratories.
